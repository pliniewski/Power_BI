# Power_BI
This is my first report presenting my ability utilizing Microsoft Power BI.
My learning exprerience took me though all nesesary steps like transforming raw data, builiding relational model and finally creating a visual report. I can proudly state that I'm able to create every visual shown in the report. It has been fascinating, gainging all knowledge about tools that enable you to present data in most understandable way possible. It really up to you how to build visual to select only the data to present a trend, success or a problem and introduce changes based upon them. I hope that I can bring these solutions to my future job position and hepl the organization grow!
